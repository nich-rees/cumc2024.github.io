## Things to Do

*Vancouver is a city that shuts down very early. Most places will usually be closed much earlier than you would expect, pretty much nothing is open by midnight, so check closing times beforehand.*

### Fun things to do in UBC

Most places on campus are accessible by walking or you can take the 68 bus which goes around campus and to the nearby Wesbrook Mall community.
- [Beaty Biodiversity Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3ner66NM7rtU3ZYQ9)
- [UBC Rose Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cfJBctS9KsoABTVY8)
- [Wreck Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yuLtrz7MUJZUygB28): This beach is right next to UBC campus, with stairs leading down right behind Vanier. It is much more isolated and in nature than other beaches here, and has great summer sunsets. (**DISCLAIMERS**: This is a clothing-optional beach; the majority of people are clothed, however, there are people who are not, so do not be rude and be mindful of who is in the background of any photos you are taking. This beach is not accessible to those with mobility impairments.) Closes right after sunset, whenever that is.
- [Museum of Anthropology](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LG2vTAj3ojzHu5eUA) at UBC
- [Cecil Green Park House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wfVq8NvpWn7vGP6GA): This is partially a graduate student residence, which is not accessible by the public. We request that you respect their privacy. There is also a chance that the main house is booked out for a private event, but if it’s not this is a very nice place to walk around in.
- [Nitobe Memorial Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VkpvBLWGEzeutumQ8): UBC's own Japanese garden! Open Tuesday - Sunday, admission is $7.00.
- [UBC Botanical Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Eizs7EgFbXq4msrF7): Open Tuesday - Sunday, admission is $11.00.
- [The Pit](https://maps.app.goo.gl/G29q3NcXC1Vss7XZ6): UBC’s very own club. It is in the basement of the Nest (the entrance is in the Nest before the building closes, and outside under the staircase after). This is open for free on Wednesday nights, which is (coincidentally) the free night for the conference.

### Fun things to do in Vancouver

- [Vancouver Aquarium](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PUrMcmrbctmDpukQA)
- [Vancouver Art Gallery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X4gQW2jnYPXMPJqVA)
- [Granville Island](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TQoBYhFqcd1QyizD7): This place is considered as a bit of a tourist trap, but it has some nice food, and the views are great.
- [Khatsahlano Street Party](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TeK85PThPNHdzGKB7): Annual street party in Vancouver, if you are here early for the weekend befoore the conference.
- You can make the journey to **Richmond** (or spend time there before your flight, as it is much closer to the airport)
    - You can do some shopping, or try some of the great Asian restaurants there. Easy places to eat are [Aberdeen Center Food Court](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aXg7SbCE3m9WSegy8)/[Richmond Public Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mypkUZXYtMpxtMtu6) (these places don't serve your typical food court food) although there are many other sit-down restaurants worth checking out as well. Things are a little cheaper, but many places here only take cash.
    - You can also check out the [Richmond Night Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EJ4AuPNuXrxSL2QS8). Note that this place is considered to be very overpriced, but can make for a memorable experience.
    - To prevent confusion for transit: southbound trains alternate between going towards Richmond ("Richmond Brighouse") and towards the airport ("YVR Airport"). They split at Bridgeport Station.

### Touching grass

NOTE: Parks located in Vancouver (surprisingly) have a closing time. Unless otherwise posted, parks/beaches are only open between 6:00 - 22:00.
- [Stanley Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TJcxzK11uSz6g3eNA): One of Vancouver's biggest local attractions. Bordered on all sides by the ocean, Stanley Park also contains Vancouvers’ Aquarium. Note that this closes surprisingly early at 17:30.
- [VanDusen Botanical Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n2Vjdw5YMgogAdaT9)
- [Queen Elizabeth Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oHVZZwTgYzYYsgZ17): There are tons of flora here, and you can get a view of downtown Vancouver. This is also where the banquet is happening on Thursday.
- Pacific Spirit Park: UBC is surrounded by this park to the East. It has good walking trails, and can be a nice place for a morning run.
- [Wreck Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kUxECQ6sDhtciWHR6): See above in the UBC section (**WARNING**: clothing-optional). You can swim at all of these beaches, including this one and below, but there are no lifegaurds.
- [Spanish Banks Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FQdZ7PP1wabDQP2D8): The closest beach to UBC that isn't Wreck. Within walking distance if you are down for a ~30 minute hike through the 
- [Locarno Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/11vsHYUiJkVWFR5Z6)/[Jericho Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZsaVaXHLsDd5yeEq7)
- [English Bay Beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e5BkiKzJ1TKvAKzD7)
- [Capilano Suspension Bridge Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JCBMBrKBJCN5Lubt5): Very pretty place, but it has a hefty entrance fee. It is also pretty far from UBC campus, so this is more of a weekend day trip.
- [Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6vaGtAFnXGSdLkq56): Another place to hike that has a suspension bridge, but it is completely free. This is also pretty far, and would be a weekend day trip.
- **Whistler**: This is a very popular hiking spot a few hours out from Vancouver by car. The village in Whistler is accessible via a shuttle that connects from Downtown, although you have to pay to take the gondola up the mountain which will connect you to most of the more interesting hikes.
- **Squamish**: Another popular hiking spot, which is only an hour long drive from Vancouver on the way to Whistler (you can usually get here on any shuttle that goes to Whistler). It is also a rock climbing mecca, if you’re into that.

### Popular shopping spots

- Downtown Vancouver has good shopping, largely not in malls but along the streets. Some places to check out are [Robson Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gJwFB1XDFoXbKLTv6) or Granville Street.
- You can find quirky stores near UBC along West Broadway and in Kerrisdale.
- [McArthurGlen Designer Outlet](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mQpGyvUTzBGe75B18): This is two train stops from the airport; perhaps something to do if you have a little downtime before your flight out.

## Food

### On campus

- [University village](https://visit.ubc.ca/eat-drink-and-stay/restaurants/food-courts/university-village-food-court/): There are sit-down restaurants, like Kokoro Mazesoba, Yunshang Rice Noodle, and Beyond BBQ (which has a grand opening menu with $10 dishes). In the basement of one of the buildings is also the [International Food Court](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Dj8VC7jZZzvDWfGT9); some student favourites are Miyame Sushi and My Home Cuisine.
- There are places to get food along Uinversity Boulevard (the bus loop).
- [Rain or Shine Ice Cream](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CrfLAKU2c25aYw8n9) if you want a sweet treat.
- Cafe’s at UBC: JJ Bean, Loafe, Tim Hortons, Starbucks, Bean Around the World, Great Dane, Blenz, Blue Chip (our student run cafe).
- Bars on campus: Gallery (on top of the nest) and Koerner's Pub (by Buchanen and the Rose Garden)

### Off campus

- [Koi Sushi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BaqxUuUj7WBoFxZj6): This is an economical option which is popular among UBC students.
- [Ramen Danbo Kitsilano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QKDAqSPKnQz2gt1U7): Very popular ramen spot. This is generally VERY busy, so we suggest avoiding peak hours, and monitoring Yelp - so you can put yourself on the waitlist. They also have a downtown location, but this is even busier.
- [Thai Away Home on Granville](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ushKvRF9V2kKsGnu7)
- [Big Way Hot Pot 大味 (Kerrisdale)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QMqEbBDkyTjGUxJz5)
- Richmond has [Aberdeen Center Food Court](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aXg7SbCE3m9WSegy8)/[Richmond Public Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mypkUZXYtMpxtMtu6) (see above).
- If you are interested, you can check out some of the [Michelin star restaurants](https://guide.michelin.com/ca/en/british-columbia/ca-vancouver/restaurants?sort=distance) of Vancouver.
- Vegan/vegetarian friendly places (some have multiple locations)
    - [Vegan Shoku Japanese Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tkyv2W726CPh1VcN7) (highly recommend)
    - [Chickpea Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VwpfmbLqXihffmVC6)
    - [MeeT on Main](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WuhJwcn8frwBzYiAA)
    - [Nuba in Kitsilano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YeVa9mtBbPoFtfKq5)

### 24/7

- All of these places are in University Village: McDonalds, A&W, Subway
- [Breka Bakery & Café - Kitsilano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CU7hY4mDVn84FteN6): 24/7 cafe that is iconic among UBC students for being so. They have pretty pastries.

## Extraneous

### Weather

- The weather will range from pleasantly warm to uncomfortably hot at times. The forecast for the week looks sunny and hot, so bring clothes fit for the weather and sunscreen!
- Carry water at all times/stay hydrated. There are water fountains in every building at UBC. We will not be providing bottled water for events taking place on campus, so bring your own bottle.
- [Irving K. Barber Learning Centre (IBLC)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TVPrvQtzogy8VK7F8) has air conditioning, and is located centrally if you ever need a quick break.

### Consuming substances responsibly

- The legal drinking age, and legal age to consume cannabis in British Columbia is 19.
- Purchasing these requires 2 pieces of government ID (one has to be a photo ID).
- Substances are not permitted inside UBC buildings. Otherwise, Vancouver is pretty liberal with their restrictions (e.g. [here](https://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/alcohol-in-parks.aspx) and [here](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/public-safety/cannabis/whats-legal) under Public use).

## Transportation

### Vancouver Transit

Vancouver’s transit system is handled entirely through a card system, called Compass. At entrances to buses, and both entrances/exits for trains, you need to tap your card to get on (and off). This can either be a Compass card (which you can purchase at vending machines in train stations or at Shoppers / London Drugs) or a credit card. With a card, you are able to transfer in a 90 minute window without paying another fee (ask for a transfer ticket if you intend to pay by cash). It is cheaper per ride to pre-load money on the Compass card, but the card costs $6 (it is technically refundable if you return your card at the end of your trip… but this is to select, inconvenient locations and no one really does it; if you want to figure this out, you should call Vancouver Translink because information online is sparse). You can load money online at [Compass Card's website](https://www.compasscard.ca) or at the machines that gave you the cards. For specific pricing, see [here](https://www.translink.ca/transit-fares/pricing-and-fare-zones).

We’ll list the specific buses to get to our event locations below, but for general transportation, UBC has a bus exchange (and a bus loop, which have distinct buses) that should be able to take you to most locations. To return to UBC, almost anywhere you should find a bus returning to UBC, i.e.

{{< center >}} “All roads lead to UBC.” {{< /center >}}

There are certain “express” buses which should take you to most destinations faster, and come more often: 99, R4, 44. **NOTE**: transit in Vancouver ends surprisingly early. Most buses and trains end their service from 12:00AM - 1:00AM. There are limited night buses (the only one that goes through UBC is the N17, which connects UBC to Downtown), but even these end their service at about 3:00 - 4:00AM.

### To and From the Airport

- Taxi/Uber is about $35-40 to UBC Vancouver campus. It is, however, cheaper than this often.
- Compass cards can be bought from the Skytrain station at YVR airport; these machines are also used to load money onto the compass cards.
- The most convenient transit route to UBC campus from the airport is to take the Skytrain Canada Line to Oakridge-41st Avenue station, and take the “R4 41st Avenue to UBC” until the end of the line. **NOTE**: Translink charges an additional $5 on top of the usual transit fee for transit rides leaving YVR (this fee does not apply to returning to the airport).
    - The intersection after getting off the train can sometimes be confusing, as there is another R4 going the other direction and getting out of the train station can be disorientating. Make sure the bus you get on says “UBC” at the top.
    - Experiment: We have not tried this, but if you are intending to transit from the airport to UBC on **Monday**, it is cheaper if you buy a day pass as you will likely transit later in the day to and from the beach for our BBQ, and there *should* be a way to get out of the YVR fee. The crucial step is after getting your Compass Card, you need to buy your day pass on the Compass Card website and not from the card machines to avoid the YVR fee.
- The most convenient transit route to the airport is taking the “R4 41st Avenue to Joyce station” to Oakridge-41st Avenue station, and taking the Skytrain Canada Line to YVR airport.
    - Southbound trains alternate between going to "Richmond Brighouse" and "YVR Airport", although their route is mostly the same, before splitting off at "Bridgeport" station. Unsurprisingly, only one of these routes will take you to your desired destination.
 
### Driving
Parking on UBC campus is limited. In the summer, you can usually get spots at the parkades, but they will cost you a pretty penny ($20 for the day, $10 to keep the car there over night). The best parkades for our locations are probably the Fraser River Parkade and the Rose Garden Parkade. There are spots along Marine Dr near Place Vanier that are free parking, however there are hardly any free spots ever and you cannot keep your vehicle there over night. For our off-campus events, parking at/near Locarno is free, and the Banquet has paid parking (however, please do not drive if you are considering drinking). 

Vancouver has many, many flashing green lights down the main roads through the city. These essentially mean the light will stay green, unless a pedestrian presses the button to cross.

### Off-Campus Events

#### Beach BBQ Social

Our opening social and dinner will be at [Locarno beach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/11vsHYUiJkVWFR5Z6) (Google Maps), and starts at 18:00. To reach the beach, you can walk (just under an hour from UBC, but along a park and beach), or you can take the 84 or 4 bus. Bussing will take about 10 minutes, followed by walking another 10.

#### Banquet

The banquet will take be held off UBC campus at [Seasons in the Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M7X9pefB1Lou6hiN7) (Google Maps). To reach the event, one can catch the 33 Bus from UBC, and take it all the way to Queen Elizabeth Park, where the restaurant is located (you will have to walk about 10 minutes through the park to get to the restaurant, it is at the top of the hill but is very scenic). The R4 also works, but your walk will be 10 minutes longer. To arrive on time, if you are taking the bus, we recommend leaving at 6:00 from UBC, and 6:30 if driving. Dinner begins at 7:00, so please arrive by then.
